Waves are shifting near the long abandonded facility in the wilting swampy forests.
This moon is focused on Cruiser mostly, allowing to take a lot of scrap with it, however its still viable without it.
Moon is similar to loot quantity to 8-Rend, however min amount is way lower, making loot quantity much more inconsistent, justifying its cost.

Moon is not balanced enough at the moment and balancing is still WIP.
